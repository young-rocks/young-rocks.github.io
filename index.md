## Highlights

**Powered by Move language and PLONK**. As a new generation of programming language for digital assets, Move guarantees secutiry of assets at the language level. Halo2 provides excellent tools for writing plonkish ciruit.

**Build a zero-knowledge proof-friendly bytecode virtual machine**. It greatly improves the programmability of zero-knowledge applications.

**Turing-completeness and fast mode**. Two types of circuits are combined: VM circuits to handle conditional branches and loops, and Move circuits, which enable bytecodes to be compiled directly into PLONKish, with smaller proof size and shorter proving time. 


## About

This project was created by Guangyu Zhu in July 2021. The goal is to improve the programmability of zero-knowledge proof techniques. It's still in the initial stage, we look forward to more developers joinning, if you are interested please contact us.
