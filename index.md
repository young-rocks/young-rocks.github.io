### Scalability

Serve as a layer2 execution engine, zkMove can generate zero-knowledge proofs for smart contracts written in Move programming language,  to "Move" computation from on-chain to off-chain, significantly improving the scalability of dApps.

### Programmability

Currently most layer2 projects are not programmable, they support only a single application scenario, and require manual development of arithmetic circuits. With the zkMove runtime environment, any smart contract can automatically generate arithmetic circuits, as long as it is written in the Move language.

### Security

zkMove runtime environment inherits the security of the underlying blockchain through zero-knowledge proof technology. In addition, it further enhances the security of smart contracts through Move, the programming language for digital assets.

### Privacy

All user transaction data on the blockchain is completely public, which largely limits the use of smart contracts. zkMove runtime environment can protect user privacy by hiding sensitive data with zero proof of knowledge.


## About

This project was created by Guangyu Zhu in July 2021. The goal is to improve the programmability of zero-knowledge proof techniques. It's still in the initial stage, we look forward to more developers joinning, if you are interested please contact us.
