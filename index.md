zkMove is a scalable smart contract runtime environment that combines the Move programming language with zero-knowledge proof technology.

### Unlimited scale

Serve as a layer2 execution engine, zkMove can generate zero-knowledge proofs for smart contracts written in Move programming language,  to "Move" computation from on-chain to off-chain, significantly improving the scalability of dApps.

### Excellent programmability

Currently most layer2 projects are not programmable, they support only a single application scenario, and require manual development of arithmetic circuits. With the zkMove runtime, any smart contract can automatically generate arithmetic circuits, as long as it is written in the Move language.

### Security beyond main chain

zkMove inherits the security of the underlying blockchain through zero-knowledge proof technology. In addition, it further enhances the security of smart contracts through Move, a next-generation programming language for digital assets.

### Cross blockchain

Unlike existing layer2 solutions, zkMove does not position itself as layer2 for a specific blockchain, but as a cross-blockchain environment for running smart contracts. A smart contract running on zkMove can directly interact with another smart contract running on zkMove regardless of the underlying blockchain, even if the underlying layer is not a blockchain.

## About

This project was created by Guangyu Zhu in July 2021. The goal is to improve the scalability of DApps using zero-knowledge proof techniques. It's still in the initial stage, we look forward to more developers joinning.

Westar Labs sponsored this project from the beginning, their help is greatly appreciated!
