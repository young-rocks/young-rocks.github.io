## Highlights

**A zero-knowledge proof-friendly bytecode virtual machine**, to solve zero-knowledge proof programmability and composability problems.

**Powered by Move language and Halo2**. As a new generation of programming language for digital assets, Move guarantees secutiry of assets at the language level. Halo2 uses Plonkish arithmetization, fitable for constructing complicated ciruit. No trusted setup required

**No compromise on performance while pursuing Turing completeness**. Two types of circuits are combined: VM circuits to handle conditional branches and loops, and Move circuits, which directly compiled from bytecodes, offer smaller proof size and shorter proving time. 


## About

This project was created by Guangyu Zhu in July 2021. The goal is to improve the programmability of zero-knowledge proof techniques. It's still in the initial stage, we look forward to more developers joinning, if you are interested please contact us.
